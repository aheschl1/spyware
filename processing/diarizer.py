"""The diarization-service client seam.

The diarize tier depends on this contract, not on pyannote: ``POST
{base}/audio/diarizations`` (multipart) answering turns with block-local
speaker labels plus one embedding per detected speaker. The diar_pyannote
container implements it; anything else that speaks the same JSON can be
swapped in via ``PROCESSING_DIARIZER_BASE_URL``.

Turns may additionally carry ``overlap_ms``/``clean_ms`` (time shared with /
free of other speakers) and a per-turn ``embedding`` computed with overlapping
speech masked out. All three are optional — an older or degraded service
omits them and the tier behaves exactly as before per-turn support existed.
Per-turn vectors are what let the tier audit a label's purity (the diarizer can
wrongly put several people under one label; its per-label aggregate cannot
reveal that) and build voice-prints free of crosstalk frames.
