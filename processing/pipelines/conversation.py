"""Tier: group a session's utterances into conversations by inter-turn gap.

A conversation closes when the silence between one utterance's end and the
next's start exceeds ``gap_ms``, and never spans a diarization block, so its
labels stay consistent; a second pass then splits it where the participants
change. A lone utterance is never a conversation. Every boundary records why
it was placed, so a later adjudicator (an LLM) can revisit it.
