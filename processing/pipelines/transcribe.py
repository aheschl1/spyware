"""Tier: transcribe every diarized utterance.

Consumes ``utterance`` artifacts (the diarize tier's ASR units — same-speaker
turns merged to the model's input window), renders each from the session
timeline, sends it to the transcription service (processing/transcriber.py —
model and protocol are environment-swappable), and records a ``transcript``
artifact on the same range. Transcripts live entirely in the artifact row —
utterances are short, so the full text fits in metadata and no blob is
written.

Diarize invalidates this tier's output when it republishes a session: it
deletes the transcripts in the same transaction that replaces the utterances,
and the queued jobs pointing at deleted utterances skip themselves.
