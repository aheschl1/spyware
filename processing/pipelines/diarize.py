"""Tier: split detected speech into per-speaker turns, with embeddings.

Consumes each session's ``speech-map`` (one diarize job per session), but
the diarizer never sees the whole session: speech-spans are re-merged into
*blocks* — contiguous speech regions — and one rendered clip per block goes
to the diarization service. Silence between blocks was already excluded by
the VAD tier and is never rendered or uploaded.

Blocks exist because diarization label consistency needs long context: within
one block "SPEAKER_00" is stable; across blocks it is not, so labels are
namespaced per block (``b{start}:SPEAKER_00``) and global identity is the
clustering tier's job — fed by the per-speaker voice-prints this tier stores
as pgvector rows (``speaker_embeddings``), queryable with distance operators.

The service also returns one embedding per *turn*, computed with overlapping
speech masked out. Those power the **purity audit**
(:func:`split_labels`): the diarizer's internal clustering sometimes puts several
people under one label, and its per-label aggregate — a blend of their
voices — cannot reveal that. When a label's own turn vectors form clearly
separated groups, the label splits into sub-labels (``SPEAKER_10.0``, ``.1``)
*before* anything is published, so utterances, transcripts, and voice-prints
all derive from the corrected labels and nothing downstream changes shape.
Voice-prints are the clean-turn-weighted mean per final label (crosstalk
frames excluded), with the service aggregate as fallback; false splits are
recoverable with the existing merge/pin tools, unlike a blended print, which
is why the audit errs toward splitting. Per-turn vectors are deliberately
ephemeral — republication recomputes them; INFO logs carry the split
diagnostics for threshold calibration.

Besides turns, the tier publishes ``utterance`` artifacts — same-speaker
turns merged into ASR-sized units — which are what the transcribe tier
consumes. That makes this tier the transcription gate: the diarizer's
segmentation hears far-field speakers the VAD misses, so gating ASR on
anything less sensitive silences one side of a conversation. Merges refuse
to span another speaker's interjection beyond a small crosstalk budget (the
whole rendered span goes to ASR, so a spanned interjection would land in the
wrong transcript). Overlap is metadata, never a gate: turns, utterances, and
(downstream) transcripts carry ``overlap_ms`` so crosstalk is queryable, but
overlapped speech is always still transcribed.

Publication is atomic: previous diarize output for the session is deleted and
the full new set (turns, utterances, embeddings, the ``diarize-map`` summary)
inserted in one transaction — along with the session's now-stale transcripts,
which this tier owns invalidating: they derive from utterances that no longer
exist. The map's presence is the completion marker consumers wait for, so
partial output is never visible and retries are idempotent.
