"""Tier: global speaker identity — batch-cluster voice embeddings.

Consumes each session's ``diarize-map`` (one job per session), but every run
re-clusters the user's **entire corpus** with constrained agglomerative
clustering (average linkage, cosine, one distance threshold): batch
re-clustering is order-independent and self-healing, where the old
attach-to-nearest-centroid design let one borderline assignment drag a
centroid between voices and snowball. Everything is scoped to (user,
embedding model) — cross-model embeddings are not comparable.

User curation persists as **constraints**, not state: ``speaker_pins`` rows
assert "this voice-print IS this identity". Pin-groups enter the
agglomeration pre-merged (must-link) and two clusters pinned to different
identities never merge (cannot-link), so manual merges and member moves
survive every rebuild. Cluster ids are otherwise ephemeral: after each run
result clusters are matched back to persistent ``speakers`` rows — pinned
identity first, else majority previous membership preferring named clusters
(named identities keep their id), else unnamed rows churn.

Assignments live in ``speaker_embeddings.speaker_id`` and cascade away with
diarize republication (embeddings regenerate under new artifact ids), but
pins are keyed on (session, label, model) and survive it; the fresh
diarize-map re-triggers clustering and the pins reclaim their identities.
Local labels on transcripts are never rewritten — global identity stays a
resolve-at-read mapping.

Batch runs are serialized per user by a transaction-scoped advisory lock:
the worker job, ``cli speakers recluster`` and ``POST /v1/speakers/recluster``
all funnel through :func:`rebuild_user_clusters`.
