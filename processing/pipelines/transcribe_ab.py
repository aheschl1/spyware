"""Tier: A/B transcript candidates — 2 models x 2 strategies per utterance.

Chained-only (discover returns nothing): `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/ab` inserts
the job directly. One run republishes the whole candidate set for the
session: for every diarized utterance it stores four `transcript-candidate`
artifacts — parakeet and whisper, each transcribed two ways:

- ``chunk``  — the utterance clip alone, exactly like the production tier.
- ``block``  — the whole diarize block transcribed once with word
  timestamps, words rebased to session time and assigned to utterances by
  midpoint. This is the strategy that gives 30s-context models (whisper) a
  fair shot; a word under crosstalk lands in every utterance whose span
  covers it, mirroring what the chunk clip's audio contains.

Candidates never touch the canonical transcript: the voting route promotes
a winner. A model/strategy failure costs that candidate, not the job — but
a run that produced nothing while erroring raises so the worker retries.
