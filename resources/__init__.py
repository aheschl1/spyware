"""The resource type registry: what kinds of data a session can hold.

A *resource* is one stream of data captured against a session — audio and
location today. Each type declares how its chunks are validated and stored
(``blob`` in the object store, or ``inline`` on the segment row) and which
capabilities the API may offer for it. Pipelines and endpoints interrogate
the registry instead of assuming audio.
