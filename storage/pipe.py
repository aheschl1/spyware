Object writes are durable as soon as they land; there is no transaction to roll
back. :mod:`services.audio` cleans up objects whose database row failed.

The S3 client is process-wide and opened on first use, the counterpart of
``database.pipe.get_pool``: building a client resolves credentials and creates
a fresh connection pool, so a client per operation would redo the TCP/TLS
handshake on every blob touch. ``BlobPipe`` only borrows it.
