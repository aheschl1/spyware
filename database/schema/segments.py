"""Pydantic models for the ``resource_segments`` table.

A row is one ingested chunk of one resource. Blob-stored resources (audio)
keep their bytes in the object store under ``object_key``; inline resources
(location) carry their parsed payload in ``payload``. Exactly one of the two
shapes holds per row — the table CHECK enforces it.
