"""Cache of each session's stitched-audio representation.

Building the representation -- the shared WAV header, the byte-offset plan, and
the strong ETag -- reads every segment row and hashes the whole set. Redoing
that on every conditional check or range seek is the audio route's dominant
cost, so the result is cached and reused until the session's segments actually
change.

A cheap per-session fingerprint (one aggregate query, no rows across the wire)
gates the cache and is read on every request, so a hit never touches the rows
and the cache stays coherent across workers: a write in another process moves
the fingerprint, which every worker sees on its next request.
